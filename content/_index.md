## Definition of DevEX

{{% note %}}
Developer Experience (DX) refers to developers' overall satisfaction and efficiency while working on software projects. It encompasses the tools, processes, and environments that shape developers' interactions with code, infrastructure, and each other. A positive DX is crucial for enhancing productivity as it directly influences how quickly and effectively developers can build, test, and deploy software.
