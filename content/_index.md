## Impact of CI/CD on modern software development and DX

{{% note %}}
In the rapidly evolving landscape of modern software development, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) stand as transformative pillars, reshaping how software is delivered and the very experience of those crafting it.  
{{% /note %}}

## Definition of DX

{{% note %}}
Developer Experience (DX) refers to developers' overall satisfaction and efficiency while working on software projects. It encompasses the tools, processes, and environments that shape developers' interactions with code, infrastructure, and each other. A positive DX is crucial for enhancing productivity as it directly influences how quickly and effectively developers can build, test, and deploy software.
